    <h1>The Red Mandarin</h1>
    <p>
        The Mandarin is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is the
        archenemy of Iron Man.[1][2][3] The character was created by Stan Lee and designed by Don Heck, first appearing
        in Tales of Suspense #50 (cover-dated February 1964).[4] The character is described as being born in China
        before the Communist revolution to a wealthy Chinese father and an English aristocratic mother, both of whom
        died when he was very young. He is characterized as a megalomaniac, attempting to conquer the world on several
        occasions, yet also possessing a strong sense of honor. Though his primary obsession is Iron Man, given his high
        status as a supervillain, he has also come into conflict with Thor, Hulk and other superheroes in the Marvel
        Universe.
